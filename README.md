Welcome to Restonode app, this app was created exclusivily for True North Company test, you can find documentation here about the following topics

# Backend

  - The backend was created purely in NodeJS with Expressjs

# Frontend

  - The frontend was created with ReactJS is an indepent application of the backend

# Database

  - The database is MongoDB integrated to the backend with Mongoose, you can get the credentials in the config file ubicated in 'config/config.json'
  - For the data visualization I recommend [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) but apps like Robomongo should work too.
